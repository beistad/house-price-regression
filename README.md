# house-price-regression
Data science and machine learning project for predicting house prices.

This project uses the data analysis and machine learning techniques from the "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" Udemy course to analyze and predict housing prices. The data comes from the ongoing Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques". The project was written in python utilizing the libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and tensorflow for data anazlysis, visualization, and modelling. 

Completed in December 2021 as a learning experience; revisited in 2025 for portfolio presentation. The original codebase was not retained; this upload highlights the methodology, statistical approach, and findings documented in the report.
